This is the readme file for my Raspberry Pi music player scripts.
It's really just a collection of scripts at this stage. 
They'll all be pulled together into something which can be run headless inside a case.

- Stream music through the Pi using mpc/mpd or Pandora
- Update an LCD display with the channel and song
- Allow for hardware inputs so it can be housed in a case
-- Play/Pause, Prev/Next, Like/Not (Pandora)

and much more...

I've found pieces of code and circuits in many places to help put this together,
but the ones that helped the most are here:

- LCD script: Matt Hawkins HD44780 Test script - http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/
- Adafruit (of course) for the wiring and plenty of resources on Raspberry Pi
- Pandora's Box Internet Radio Player - plenty of help with pianobar:
