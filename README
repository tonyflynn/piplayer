*** ALPHA ***

This is the readme file for my Raspberry Pi music player scripts - it's really just a collection of
scripts at this stage. They'll all be pulled together into something which
can be run headless inside a case.

The code has been adapted from a number of sources, all of which will be listed here
once I'm done.

- Stream music through the Pi using mpc/mpd or Pandora
- Update an LCD display with the channel and song
- Allow for hardware inputs so it can be housed in a case
-- Play/Pause, Prev/Next, Like/Not (Pandora)

and much more...

If you have any questions or comments, let me know at tonyflynn@gmail.com.
