This is the readme file for my piplayer scripts

I'm developing this set of scripts to run my Raspberry Pi music player.

Code has come from a number of sources, all of which will be listed here
once I'm done.

- Stream music through the Pi using mpc/mpd
- Update an LCD display with the channel and song
- Allow for hardware inputs so it can be housed in a case

and much more...

If you have any questions or comments, let me know at tonyflynn@gmail.com.
